Kmart was created by the SS Kresge discount store chain in 1962, following in the footsteps of innovators in the Northeast like EJ Korvette's. Discount general merchandise stores became a hot concept. Dayton's Department Store of Minneapolis and others thought there might be an opportunity in "upscale" discount stores, creating Target in the same year. Independent dime store operator Sam Walton also thought small towns could use discount stores, and opened his first Walmart in 1962. But Kmart quickly became the giant of the industry, and was one of the hottest stocks on the market. When this list was compiled in 1969, Walmart was too small to show up! Today the company is bigger than Target and Kmart combined.
